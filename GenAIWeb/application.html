          <h2>Real World Examples</h2>
          <p class="justify-text">Generative AI is being used more and more in schools through tools like ChatGPT. These tools 
            help students write essays, summarize readings, and practice other skills like learning a new 
            language. While this can be helpful for learning, it also brings up problems. Some students use 
            AI to do their work and turn it in without saying it was written by a computer. This raises concerns 
            about cheating and whether students are really learning the material. As a result, many schools are 
            thinking about changing their rules and teaching students how to use AI the right way.
            In the world of art and design, tools like Midjourney and DALL·E let people make images just by 
            typing in a few words. This is helpful for things like making ads, logos, or artwork quickly. 
            But many artists are upset because some AI tools were trained using their work without asking 
            for permission. This brings up important questions about who owns the images that AI creates, 
            and whether it's fair to use someone else's work to train these systems. These issues show why 
            we need better rules and more openness about how these AI tools are made and used.

          <h2>Social Challenges</h2>
          <p class="justify-text">Even though generative AI can be very useful, it also brings up some serious 
            challenges. In education, it’s hard to tell when a student is learning or just relying on AI to do 
            the work. This makes it tricky for teachers to give fair grades and keep learning honest. In art 
            and design, AI can create amazing images in seconds, but it often uses other people’s work to 
            learn sometimes without asking. This upsets artists who feel their work is being used without 
            credit or payment. These situations matter because they affect fairness, creativity, and trust. 
            What makes it hard to use generative AI well is finding a balance between using it to help people 
            and making sure it doesn’t harm others or take away from human effort (Heaven, 2023). </p>
