          <h2>Implications</h2>
          <h3>Social Implication</h3>
          <p class="justify-text"> Generative AI brings up many important issues that need careful thought. Socially, it can spread false information and deep fakes, which can harm public trust and affect democracy (Chesney & Citron, 2019). It also risks job loss in creative and professional areas, which can increase economic inequality (Eloundou et al., 2023), and may strengthen cultural biases because of the focus on Western data (Bender et al., 2021). </p>

          <h3>Political Implication</h3>
          <p class="justify-text">Politically, generative AI can be used for propaganda, spying, and manipulation, especially in places without strong rules (Brundage et al., 2018). When used without regulation, it raises worries about accountability and the risk of misuse by authoritarian governments. These AI systems often repeat and increase existing biases, which can lead to harmful or unfair content. Moreover, they require a lot of computing power, which has environmental impacts, and they can be used for bad purposes like phishing or identity theft (Strubell et al., 2019). </p>
            
          <p class="justify-text">Because of these issues, generative AI needs strong rules, transparency, and open discussions to make sure it benefits society in a responsible way. </p>

          <h2>Generative AI and Social Ethics</h2>
          <p class="justify-text">Looking at generative AI from different ethical views helps us understand its effects on society. From a utilitarian view, it’s good if it makes things easier and shares knowledge while also reducing problems like job loss or spreading false information (Binns, 2018). A deontological approach says it’s wrong to use AI in dishonest ways, like making fake videos or copying someone else’s work, even if the results are useful (Taddeo & Floridi, 2018).  </p>

          <p class="justify-text">  Virtue ethics focuses on how responsibly AI is used—good intentions lead to ethical use, while careless use shows bad morals (Coeckelbergh, 2020). The ethics of care highlights the importance of empathy, suggesting AI should help protect vulnerable groups (Held, 2006). Lastly, social contract theory emphasizes fairness, transparency, and the need for public trust (Martin, 2019). These different views help us see the social impact of generative AI, from new ideas to ethical issues.  </p>

          <h2>Handling AI Risks</h2>
          <p class="justify-text">To reduce the harmful impacts of generative AI, a combination of technological, social, and policy strategies is essential. Technologically, developers should implement safety measures like adversarial testing, reinforcement learning from human feedback, and privacy-preserving methods such as differential privacy and federated learning (OpenAI, 2023; Kairouz et al., 2021). Transparency through tools like model cards also helps clarify system limitations (Mitchell et al., 2019). Socially, improving public AI literacy and encouraging responsible online platforms can reduce misuse, such as misinformation or deepfakes (Floridi et al., 2018). At the policy level, regulations like the EU AI Act aim to classify AI risks and mandate oversight, while transparency in model development and independent audits can promote accountability and trust (European Commission, 2021; Brundage et al., 2020).
