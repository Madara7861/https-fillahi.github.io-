            <h2>Technology Selection</h2>

        <h2>What is Generative AI?</h2>
        <p class="justify-text">Generative AI is essentially a form of AI that applies advanced learning methods to develop new 
          media like pictures, videos, music, graphs, animation, 3D models, texts, and more. A common 
          misconception is that traditional AI and generative AI are the same thing, however this is 
          actually not true. The main difference between the two is that traditional AI analyzes tasks 
          and generative AI generates new content. Traditional AI can function with a tiny set of data, 
          whereas generative AI on the other hand has to function with a bigger dataset; this all varies 
          based on how complex the task is and what type of model is being used. There are various models 
          of generative AI that are being applied, such as GPT-n (ChatGPT is a key application apart of 
          the GPT models). Generative AI works through the extent of understanding patterns of information 
          within a platform. Generative AI models learn from larger dataset examples and from that they can 
          generate new media based on what they have learned from before. Generative AI usually applies 
          advanced neural designs, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders 
          (VAEs). Key components of GANs are the discriminator and the generator. The generator creates new 
          data, while the accuracy is assessed by the discriminator. The quality of generated results 
          improves with further evaluations and feedback based on specific preferences (Office of 
          Communications, College of Education, 2024).</p>

        <h2>Why Did Our team Choose Generative AI?</h2>
        <p class="justify-text">Our team decided to choose generative AI because of wide range of opportunities and creativity it 
          is able to provide. Generative AI matters because it is the future of technology. Generative AI can 
          provide a plethora of possibilities in any field or industry. It could be used to generate 
          simulations for education, develop patient-based treatment plans in healthcare, generating video 
          game or film media for entertainment, making targeted campaigns in marketing, and much more 
          (Office of Communications, College of Education, 2024). Generative AI has endless potential to 
          shape the future.</p>
