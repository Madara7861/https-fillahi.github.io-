        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>I took IT 104 with professor Daniel Garrison who taught me a great amount of what I have learned so far. Through this course I gained experience with how to develop a website with HTML through Visual Studio Code. 
          I made my first website based on my research project on the impact of virtual reality on health care businesses. It was a very interesting topic to research, it expanded my knowledge about different medical methods. 
          For instance, virtual reality could be used for surgical simulations to teach future surgeons how to perform surgery, which comes to show how much potential virtual reality will have as progress into the future. For more information you can visit my research project website in the link below.
